  Spatial point pattern analysis plays an important role in various fields, such as biology, ecology, geography, urban planning, etc. When point patterns involve more than species, one important question is how each pair of
patterns interact in terms of their locations. For example, it is meaningful to investigate whether two types of
trees are distributed dispersively in ecology, or whether one type of T cells and targeted tumor cells interact
positively (i.e. co-localized in their locations in microscopic images) during treatment of some type of cancer. This research presents a novel method called Besag’s L function-typed Co-ordinate-Based Co-localization
method (LCBC) that utilizes correlation analysis as a powerful tool for local statistical summaries of the
co-localization degree of bivariate point patterns at different scales of observation distances and global summary
for the whole image. Building upon the foundation of Besag’s L functions, CBC and KCBC methods, the
proposed LCBC aims to study how to effectively eliminate inherent biases in the original CBC method at the
global level and how it outperforms KCBC. The mathematical derivations of LCBC and the algorithm are
presented. We conduct 200 simulations of complete spatial randomness to examine the effectiveness of LCBC
under both methods and also examine local distributions. The results show that the equal area method
outperforms the equal distance method and has fewer biases compared to KCBC. We then apply the LCBC
algorithm to real swamp data, which was also used in Dixon's paper for Ripley's K function, and utilize the
random labeling method to obtain 95% and 5% confidence limits. The results of the real data application are
consistent with Dixon's findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the LCBC algorithm.
